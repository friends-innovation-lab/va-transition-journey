# Journey Map: Transitioning Out of Service

This document describes the veteran journey this prototype serves — the transition from military to civilian life.

---

## Why This Journey

We chose "Transitioning Out of Service" for the prototype because:

- **It's universal** — Every veteran goes through it
- **It's high-stakes** — Decisions made here affect decades of benefits
- **It's fragmented today** — Veterans must navigate VBA, VHA, NCA, DoD, and DoL separately
- **VEO has mapped it** — Existing research identifies the moments that matter
- **It crosses organizational boundaries** — Proves journey-based design works across VA silos

---

## The Current Experience

Today, a transitioning service member must:

1. Attend TAP (Transition Assistance Program) classes at DoD
2. Visit VA.gov and navigate 11+ benefit categories
3. Figure out which benefits they're eligible for
4. Visit separate portals for health care, disability, education
5. Track multiple applications across disconnected systems
6. Miss deadlines because nothing is connected
7. Call VSOs or VA hotlines when confused

**The experience is organized around VA's org chart, not the veteran's situation.**

## The Journey Stages

Based on VEO's journey mapping work, the transition journey has distinct stages:

### Stage 1: Preparing (6-12 months before separation)

**Veteran mindset:** "What do I need to know?"

**Key moments:**
- Learning what benefits exist
- Understanding eligibility requirements
- Starting disability claim process (if applicable)
- Attending TAP classes

**Current pain points:**
- Information overload
- No personalized guidance
- VA and DoD systems don't talk

---

### Stage 2: Separating (0-3 months around separation date)

**Veteran mindset:** "What do I need to do right now?"

**Key moments:**
- Final medical exams
- Submitting claims before separation
- Enrolling in VA health care
- Choosing education benefits
- Address and direct deposit updates

**Current pain points:**
- Deadline pressure
- Paper forms
- Multiple logins and portals
- Fear of missing something critical

---

### Stage 3: Settling (3-12 months after separation)

**Veteran mindset:** "Did I do everything? What's the status?"

**Key moments:**
- Tracking claim decisions
- First VA health care appointment
- Starting education benefits
- Updating information as life stabilizes

**Current pain points:**
- Opaque status tracking
- Long wait times with no updates
- Discovering missed benefits too late

---

### Stage 4: Thriving (12+ months after separation)

**Veteran mindset:** "What else is available to me?"

**Key moments:**
- Life changes (marriage, kids, home purchase)
- Career transitions
- Ongoing health care
- Survivor benefit planning

**Current pain points:**
- Benefits change but veterans aren't notified
- No proactive outreach
- Must re-learn the system for each new need
